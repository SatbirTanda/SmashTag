# SmashTag

Written in Swift 1.2,  this app allows a user to use their twitter account to search for tweets that use certain hashtags.  When a user taps on tweet, they can view all mentions in the tweet - whether they be users tagged, hashtags used, urls referenced, or images included.  I made this app in order to master learning how to implement a UITableViewController and how UITableViewDelegate methods are called.  I also learned about UICollectionViews, Grand Central Dispatch (for async tasks off the main queue), WebViews, and strong reference cycles.

Based on Stanford's Assignment 4!  This app was made in 2015 with XCode 6.4 because of its swift 1.2 compiler.
