# SmashTag

Written in Swift 1.2,  this app allows a user to use their twitter account to search for tweets that use certain hashtags.  When a user taps on tweet, they can view all mentions in the tweet - whether they be users tagged, hashtags used, urls referenced, or images included.  I made this app in order to master learning how to implement a UITableViewController and how UITableViewDelegate methods are called.  I also learned about UICollectionViews, Grand Central Dispatch (for async tasks off the main queue), WebViews, and strong reference cycles.
